# AB3GY buildme app
A very customized script used to build my personal package directory.  Does not adhere to any python package build conventions.  Copies files from other personal repositories.  

Uniquely named to avoid conflict with standard package build scripts e.g., setup.py  

**Do not run this script in the repository directory.  It might copy files into the directory that you don't want.**
